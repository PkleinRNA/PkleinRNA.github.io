**Title**:  
Investigating the role of the ribosomal large subunit pseudouridine synthase B (RluB) in tobramycin tolerance in Vibrio cholerae.

**Abstract**:  
The massive and inappropriate use of antibiotics has led to their widespread dissemination in the environment, where they are encountered as concentration gradients. While many studies have addressed the effects of lethal antibiotic doses on bacterial physiology, far less is known about how bacteria respond to so-called subinhibitory concentrations (i.e., levels below the minimal inhibitory concentration), even though these are likely the levels most frequently experienced in natural settings. Using Vibrio cholerae, a bacterium that alternates between aquatic reservoirs and the human host and therefore faces strong environmental and antibiotic pressures, we found that rRNA modification enzymes play a major role in adaptation to subinhibitory antibiotic exposure.
In this study, we focused on one enzyme in particular, RluB, a pseudouridine synthase catalysing the formation of pseudouridine at position 2588 of the 23S rRNA in V. cholerae. We showed that deletion of rluB leads to increased tolerance to tobramycin, an antibiotic targeting the 30S ribosomal subunit. Analysis of catalytic mutants of RluB further indicated that this phenotype is not driven by the absence of the rRNA modification itself, but rather by the presence of RluB as a protein. Preliminary experiments suggest that ribosomes from the ΔrluB mutant may display increased translational fidelity but reduced stability. Ongoing work combines epistasis analyses with other ribosomal components, reporter fusions to quantify translation efficiency, sucrose gradient analyses of ribosome integrity, and omics approaches to define the molecular basis of this phenotype and to clarify how RluB contributes to bacterial adaptation to subinhibitory aminoglycoside exposure.
