The RNA Degradation Machineries in Hyperthermophile Archaea

Bouvier) in collaboration with OncoRib team (P. Espirito-Santo, D. Rinaldi, C. Plisson-Chastang),

**Abstract**:  
Our study model are the hyperthermophile archaea Thermococcus barophilus and Pyrococcus
abyssi from Thermococcales order. Their ability to grow at temperatures above 100°C provides
unique opportunity to address the stability of RNA, DNA and proteins at extremely high
temperatures. Archaea are ubiquitous in all ecosystems (oceans, soil, microbiota) but serve as
exemplary models for the study of life in extreme conditions. Their unique, intermediate status
between bacteria and eukaryotes offers insights into the evolution of both molecular and genetic
processes and central metabolic pathways.
We have identified key players of RNA degradation machinery in Thermococcales: the RNA
exoribonucleases aRNaseJ (5&#39;-3&#39;) and the RNA Exosome (3&#39;-5&#39;), as well as RNA Helicases - ASH-Ski2 &amp;
Lhr2. The objective of our research is to gain insight into the mechanisms by which these factors are
specifically recruited to regulate the RNA life cycle at the post-transcriptional level. The network of
molecular interactions established in Thermococcales by affinity pull-down experiments suggests the
existence of interactions between 5&#39; and 3&#39; degradation machineries, as well as with the ribosome
and helicases. Our recent research has focused on the comprehensive characterization of the RNA
exosomes. The RNA exosome in archaea is constituted by nine protein subunits that assemble to
form a barrel-like structure, with a cap at its apex. The barrel is composed of a trimer of Rrp41/Rrp42
dimers. The phosphorolytic activity of the complex is carried out by the three Rrp41 subunits. The
cap is comprised of a trimer of Rrp4 and Csl4, the in vivo stoichiometry of which is currently
unknown. This trimeric complex serves to facilitate the recognition of RNA substrates and their
subsequent insertion into the lumen of the catalytic barrel, where the RNA degradation occurs. This
3&#39;-5&#39; degradation machinery is orthologous to nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA exosomes in eukaryotes.
We aim at characterizing the RNA exosome composition in vivo, its protein partners and substrates.
In this purpose, we have performed co-immunoprecipitations of the RNA exosome of T.
barophilus followed by LC/MS analysis. All exosome subunits and the exosome&#39;s known in
vitro partners, ASH-Ski2 and aRNaseJ, were successfully recovered. LC/MS analysis identified over 30
proteins that were enriched in the sample. In order to characterize the different variants of
exosome in vivo, we have reconstituted in vitro the RNA exosome with two different homogeneous
caps (Rrp4 and Csl4). We have obtained cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) images of RNA
exosomes at 3.4A resolution. These models serve as a basis for the subsequent in
vivo characterization of the RNA exosome variants. I will present the progress of this work.
