**Title**:  
Regulation of local translation and axon development by m6A RNA methylation

**Abstract**:  
The localization and translation of mRNAs in neurons are regulated by RNA-binding proteins and play a crucial role in neuronal
development. In this study, we provide evidence that the multifunctional RNA-binding protein Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) is encoded by an mRNA
modified with N6-methyladenosine (m6A). This modification enhances APC translation in neuronal somata through YTHDF m6A reader proteins. Disruptions
in APC expression, caused by reduced levels of the m6A writer METTL14 or the reader YTHDF1, or by overexpression of METTL14 mutants carrying autismand
schizophrenia-associated human missense mutations, impair the transport and local translation of APC-regulated target mRNA β-actin in axons and
growth cones. Consequently, these disruptions hinder axon development both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which m6Adependent
global expression of the RNA-binding protein APC regulates axonal mRNA translation and development.

**Title**:
Does 53BP1 bind to RNA-DNA primers to prevent the activation of innate immune response?

**Abstract**:  
Genomic instability has many incomes, either endogenous or exogenous sources. In addition to
pathogenic DNA, self-DNA, which are accumulated in cytosol can activate innate immune responses,
leading to the production of type 1 interferon (IFN) stimulated genes (ISG). This activation would be
mediated by the cGAS-STING pathway. 53BP1 is well known as a mediator of the double-strand break
repair, but it is also involved into fork protection under replicative stress. The team has recently
found that 53BP1 protein binds to RNA-DNA primers in unperturbated DNA replication. We ask
whether the binding activity of 53BP1 can play a protective role against uncontrolled release of RNA-
DNA chimeras. We have shown that depletion of 53BP1 activates expression of many markers of
inflammatory type I interferons.
