**Title**:
Does 53BP1 bind to RNA-DNA primers to prevent the activation of innate immune response?

**Abstract**:  
Genomic instability has many incomes, either endogenous or exogenous sources. In addition to
pathogenic DNA, self-DNA, which are accumulated in cytosol can activate innate immune responses,
leading to the production of type 1 interferon (IFN) stimulated genes (ISG). This activation would be
mediated by the cGAS-STING pathway. 53BP1 is well known as a mediator of the double-strand break
repair, but it is also involved into fork protection under replicative stress. The team has recently
found that 53BP1 protein binds to RNA-DNA primers in unperturbated DNA replication. We ask
whether the binding activity of 53BP1 can play a protective role against uncontrolled release of RNA-
DNA chimeras. We have shown that depletion of 53BP1 activates expression of many markers of
inflammatory type I interferons.
