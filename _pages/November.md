Title: Nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1 Maintains Chromatin-Independent Transcriptional
Silencing through a Transgenerational Small RNA Feedback Loop

Abstract:
Epigenetic inheritance of transcriptional silencing is traditionally attributed to chromatin-
based mechanisms in which Argonaute–small RNA complexes recruit histone-modifying
enzymes. In this project, we found that in Caenorhabditis elegans, the nuclear
Argonaute HRDE-1 maintains germline transcriptional repression independently of
canonical heterochromatin marks. Using inducible, germline-specific HRDE-1 depletion
combined with nuclear sorting, CUT&amp;Tag, and nascent transcription profiling, we
identified endogenous genes that become transcriptionally activated upon loss of
HRDE-1 despite retaining H3K9me3 and H3K23me3. HRDE-1 directly restrains RNA
polymerase II (Pol II) while simultaneously promoting antisense small RNA production in
perinuclear condensates, thereby coupling nuclear transcriptional repression to small
RNA biogenesis. HRDE-1 loss causes progressive erosion of antisense small RNAs
and delays silencing re-establishment, revealing a transgenerational feedback loop in
which small RNAs, and not chromatin modifications, constitute the primary heritable
signal. These findings redefine nuclear Argonautes as active drivers of RNA-based
epigenetic inheritance and broaden our understanding of how small RNA pathways
maintain transcriptional silencing across generations.
