**Title**:  
Completing the picture of the translation apparatus: ABC-F proteins at the rescue of the ribosome.

**Abstract**:  
The canonical bacterial translation apparatus, established since the 1970s, has enabled the development of minimal systems for in vitro protein production. However, this core machinery remains incomplete, requiring additional translation factors to assist ribosomes in synthesizing specific amino acid sequences. Our research focuses on a novel family of translation factors (TFs) known as the ABC-F protein family which is conserved from bacteria to humans. We have discovered that these TFs can rescue ribosomes stalled during the polymerization of specific sequences or in response to antibiotics. Specifically, we elucidate the unique physiological function of one member, EttA, in facilitating the ribosomal synthesis of proteins with poly-acidic residues early in the sequence. Furthermore, we demonstrate its impact on the global regulation of gene expression in Escherichia coli. This newly characterized function unifies the roles of ABC-F factors and uncovers a new level of gene expression regulation in bacteria.
