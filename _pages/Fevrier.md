**Title**:  
RNA design with AI

**Abstract**:  
RNA design consists of discovering a nucleotide sequence that optimizes predefined criteria. A criterion can be that the generated RNA folds into a target secondary structure or tertiary structure. Another criterion can be to maximize the structure of the mRNA for example. We propose to use Monte Carlo Tree Search for RNA design. The algorithm and its applications to RNA design will be presented.
