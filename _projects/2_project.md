<span style="font-size: 1.5em;"><strong>Program description: </strong></span><br> The goal of the UMass Chan Early Independence Fellows Program is to recruit clusters of exceptionally talented junior scientists with the potential to become independent investigators at UMass Chan Medical School, and to provide them with career development, mentoring, and financial support to foster their scientific excellence and leadership. In recognition of diversity as a driver of innovation and scientific impact, we are committed to building and sustaining an inclusive environment with talented individuals from all backgrounds, including backgrounds that are underrepresented in medicine and the biomedical sciences, who embrace a commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion in line with our institutional goals (IMPACT 2025).  

Successful applicants will be brought on as a part of an interdisciplinary cohort. Fellows will join one of two tracks: The Maraganore Early Independence Fellows track or the Chan Early Independence Fellows track. The Chan Early Independence Fellows track will support two fellows who will develop an independent research program that broadly aligns with any area of excellence at UMass Chan. The Maraganore Early Independence Fellows track will support one fellow who will develop an independent research program in the areas of RNA biology or RNA therapeutics in the RNA Therapeutics Institute (RTI).
 
<span style="font-size: 1.5em;"><strong>Key Details</strong></span><br>
Tracks: The Maraganore Early Independence Fellows (RNA biology, RNA therapeutics) and Chan Early Independence Fellows (any area of excellence at UMass Chan). 

<span style="font-size: 1.5em;"><strong>Eligibility:</strong></span><br> Applicants should have a PhD, MD/PhD, or other doctoral degree and be within 24 months of completing their terminal degree.
